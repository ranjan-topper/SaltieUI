            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>All bookings of Trips are also subject to the Terms and Conditions of the Supplier of the Service(s) incorporated in a Trip. </strong>By placing an order with Saltie, you agree to abide by all the Terms and Conditions of the applicable
                Suppliers without reservation, and to be bound by the limitations therein including but not limited to payment of all amounts when due, compliance with the Supplier&rsquo;s rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares,
                products or services, and signing of third party liability waivers prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such Supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation
                of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such

                <li><strong> Eligibility. </strong>The Services offered by Saltie are available for purchase by residents of the United States while in the United States, its territories, possessions, and protectorates, who have all the requisite power and
                    authority to enter into and perform the obligations under these Terms and Conditions. The Lead Passenger (the Traveler who submits a Trip reservation for themselves and others) must be over the age of 18 to purchase a Saltie Trip and
                    agree to these Terms and Conditions.</li>

            <ol start="2">
                <li><strong> Modification of Our Terms and Conditions. </strong>Our Terms and Conditions may be amended or modified by us at any time, without notice, on the understanding that such changes will not apply to Trips booked prior to the amendment
                    or modification. &nbsp;It is therefore essential that you consult and accept our Terms and Conditions at the time of making a booking, particularly in order to determine which provisions are in operation at that time in case they have
                    changed since the last time you placed an order with Saltie or reviewed our Terms and Conditions.</li>
                <li><br /> <strong>3<em>. </em>Prices and Surcharges. </strong>Our prices are contractual tariffs. &nbsp;No claim relating to the price of a Trip will be considered once the reservation is effective. All prices are quoted in US dollars (US$).
                    Rates for Services are based on tariffs and exchange rates in effect at the time of posting and are subject to change prior to departure. Substantial changes in tariffs, exchange rates, the price of fuel, Services and labor sometimes
                    increase the cost of Travel arrangements significantly. Saltie reserves the right to alter prices or introduce surcharges accordingly, even if payment has been received in full</li>

            <p>Unless otherwise stated in the description of a Trip, the following amounts will <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> be included as part of one of a Trip&rsquo;s advertised price:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>airfare to/from the Trip start point, including domestic or inter-country connecting flights</li>
                <li>items of a personal nature such as incidentals, toiletries, etc.</li>
                <li>costs associated with Passports or Visas</li>
                <li>excess baggage charges</li>
                <li>inspection, customs, immigration and naturalization fees</li>
                <li>single room supplement</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol class="olCssCustom">
                <li>International credit cards including Discover, American Express, Visa and MasterCard.</li>
                <li>Wire transfer payment with all wiring and transfer fees and costs paid by the sender*, and</li>
                <li>XXXX</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>*Wire transfers: Account: XXXXXX, Account Name: XXXXXXXX. Please be sure to add your wire transfer fees for processing.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>If we could not take payment from your payment card account, we will send you an email or call you regarding the matter. This could be because of insufficient funds in your payment card account, incorrect details provided by you on our site,
                any fraud alerts received from our fraud prevention system or if your bank declined the transaction. You can also contact your bank or card issuing company to authorize your transaction or provide us a different payment card acceptable
                by Saltie. We do not take responsibility for any damages caused by the non-acceptance of your payment for whatever reason.&nbsp; If we notice any fraudulent transaction from the provided credit or debit card, we will inform such activity
                to our Credit Card Verification Company, bank, or Supplier, and if required we will also inform the appropriate legal authorities. We process all credit and debit card transactions securely and transmit the data using SSL.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge
                you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website.
                In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card
                company, we may pass on your payment to an international Supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these
                fees or the exchange rate applied to your Trip booking, please contact your bank.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Suppliers have their own policies in regards to cancellation or alterations. All Travelers should review those policies prior to purchase. The Supplier cancellation penalties on payments will be determined by the individual Suppliers and
                    Vendors, not Saltie.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Changes, cancellations, and refunds may not always be possible. Payments for flights, cruises and other Services may be completely non-refundable due to airlines and Supplier policies.</li>
                <li>Cancellation will be applied based on the date on which we receive written notification pursuant to the enclosed section entitled &ldquo;Notices.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Any cancellation or alteration of your booking may result in costs that will be billed by our Suppliers, and our administrative costs may be added to these. &nbsp;In the event of an alteration, these costs will be billed to you. In the
                    event of cancellation, these costs are deducted from the refund payable to you as per this agreement.</li>
                <li>The cancellation of your booking for whatever reason does not exempt you from paying all the sums that you owe us. Any interrupted or shortened stay, or any Service not actually used by you, for whatever reason (in particular in the event
                    that you fail to arrive in time to enjoy the Services) does not entitle you to a refund.</li>
                <li>As a general rule alterations, whatever their nature, are treated as a cancellation followed by a new booking, involving the relevant cancellation charges. These charges will be added to any costs charged by the Supplier, of which you
                    will be informed before the alteration is made.</li>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the unlikely event that a major change (involving a change of departure or return date, departure city or destination) becomes necessary, we will notify you as soon as possible and will try to substitute comparable Services. In the event
                of complete cancellation by us, our only liability will be limited to a refund of all monies paid. Saltie is not responsible for additional expenses incurred by Travelers in preparation or anticipation of their Trip (i.e. medical expenses,
                insurance charges, international airfare, etc.).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While we always endeavor to avoid changes and cancellations, we must reserve the right to do so and to substitute alternative arrangements of comparable monetary value without compensation. Saltie reserves the right to adjust the Itinerary
                or change the modes of ground and air travel, change the quality of Accommodations or otherwise change a Trip as necessary without prior notice. We accept no liability for loss of enjoyment as a result of these changes.&nbsp; Saltie will
                attempt to provide advanced notice of any changes to Itinerary or Services to the extent possible.</p>

            <p>Upon cancellation of the transportation or travel Services, where the Traveler is not at fault and has not canceled in violation of any terms and conditions previously clearly and conspicuously disclosed and agreed to by the Traveler, all
                sums paid to the seller of travel for services not provided will be promptly paid to the Traveler, unless the Traveler advises the seller of travel in writing, after cancellation.&nbsp; In California, this provision does not apply where
                the seller of travel has remitted the payment to another registered wholesale seller of travel or a carrier, without obtaining a refund, and where the wholesaler or provider defaults in providing the agreed-upon transportation or service.
                In this situation, the seller of travel must provide the Traveler with a written statement accompanied by bank records establishing the disbursement of the payment, and if disbursed to a wholesale seller of travel, proof of current registration
                of that wholesaler.</p>

                    address before your departure date, you are required to advise us of the change. If a Traveler provides incorrect information to Saltie, we do not assume any liability if the Trip is adversely affected or made impossible by the non-receipt

                    verify that special needs can be met. Depending on their terms and conditions, your reservation may be refunded, canceled or modified if special handicapped needs cannot be met. Saltie make no guarantee as to the ability of any Accommodations,

                <li><strong> Insurance</strong>. Should you have to cancel your Trip because of illness, injury or death to you or an immediate family member, depending on the type of coverage purchased, Trip cancellation insurance may protect some or all
                    deposits and payments for both air and Tour costs. Trip cancellation and interruption penalties are significant. Purchasing Trip cancellation insurance at a much later date may limit some of the coverage as to pre-existing or other
                    conditions. Saltie <u>strongly</u> recommends the immediate purchase of Trip cancellation insurance including emergency medical evacuation, trip delay (interruption or after departure coverage), baggage and repatriation.</li>

            <p>Most international Trips require a passport valid until at least six (6) months beyond the scheduled end of your Itinerary.&nbsp; Non-U.S. citizens should contact the appropriate consular office for any requirements pertaining to their Trip.&nbsp;
                Further information on entry requirements can be obtained from the State Department, by phone (202) 647-5335 or access online at <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports.html">http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports.html</a>                or directly from the destination country's website.</p>

            <p>Some countries require you to be in possession of a return ticket or exit ticket and have sufficient funds, etc.&nbsp; Similarly, certain countries require that the Traveler produce evidence of insurance/repatriation coverage before it will
                issue a visa.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br /> You must carefully observe all applicable formalities and ensure that the surnames and forenames used for all passengers when making a booking and appearing in your travel documents (booking forms, travel tickets, vouchers, etc.), correspond
                exactly with those appearing on your passport, visas, etc.</p>

            <p>WE CANNOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU ARE REFUSED PASSAGE ON ANY AIRLINE, CRUISE, TRANSPORT OR ENTRY INTO ANY COUNTRY DUE TO THE FAILURE ON YOUR PART TO CARRY OR OBTAIN THE CORRECT DOCUMENTATION. IF FAILURE TO DO SO RESULTS IN FINES, SURCHARGES,

                <li><strong> Accommodations.</strong> &ldquo;Accommodations&rdquo; are any lodgings in a dwelling or similar living quarters afforded to Travelers including, but not limited to, hotels, quarters in ships and charters, motels, and resorts.
                    Saltie provides the accommodations for its Trips through third-party Suppliers and retains no ownership or management interest in those Accommodations. Saltie does not guarantee the location or the amenities of the Accommodations nor
                    the performance of the third-party Vendors.&nbsp; If any issues arise, please contact the owner/operators of the respective Accommodations directly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Accommodations and living standards may vary from country to country, especially in some of the remote locations we visit. Saltie makes no guarantees about the living standards in remote locations, but we will try to work with an Accommodation
                provider within the same category you purchased, if available, should serious problems as to habitability arise. Any additional costs, i.e. upgrades etc., will be borne by the Traveler.</p>
            <p>Prices of Accommodations are based on double occupancy unless described otherwise.&nbsp; If you prefer single Accommodations, some Accommodations require you to pay a single supplement fee which can vary depending on the Accommodation.&nbsp;
                Please contact us for specifics on the single supplement fees.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Saltie&rsquo; responsibilities in respect to air travel are limited by the relevant airline&rsquo;s Contract of Carriage.&nbsp; All airline Contracts of Carriage are available for view publicly on their websites and at their office branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Saltie is not able to specify the type of aircraft to be used by any airline or guarantee seat assignments.&nbsp; In addition, Saltie is not responsible for losses due to cancelled flights, seats, or changed flight itineraries.&nbsp; Airlines
                retain the right to adjust flight times and schedules at any time, and these changes may include a change in the airline you fly, your aircraft type or destination.&nbsp; Such alterations do not constitute a significant change to your
                Trip Itinerary. If an airline cancels or delays a flight, you should work with the airline to ensure you arrive at your destination on or ahead of time. Saltie will not provide any refund for Trips missed, in part or full, due to missed,
                cancelled or delayed flights, or other flight irregularities including, without limitation, denied boarding whether or not you are responsible for such denial.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Airline flights may be overbooked. A person denied boarding on a flight may be entitled to a compensatory payment or other benefits from the airline.&nbsp; The rules for denied boarding are available at all ticket counters in your Contract
                of Carriage. The airline fulfilling your reservation <em>may</em> change from the airline displayed on our website. Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and other travel
                suppliers may change their prices without notice.&nbsp;</p>

                Saltie will endeavor to inform Traveler as soon as possible in the event of any flight alteration.</p>

            <p>Failure to check-in for a flight on the outward journey (on a charter or scheduled flight) will automatically result in cancellation of the return flight by the airline. We would encourage you to contact us on the date of departure if you
                wish us to keep the return flight open; this decision remains at the discretion of the airline company.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If any booked flight connecting with your outbound or inbound flight is cancelled or delayed, the airlines reserve the right to provide that transport by any other means (coach/bus, train, etc.).&nbsp; If you organize your own connecting transport
                with the arrangements booked with Saltie, we would advise that you reserve flexible or refundable tickets in order to avoid the risk of any financial loss. &nbsp;You are also advised not to make any important appointments for the day following
                your return date. Saltie cannot accept responsibility for the consequences of delays (such as a cancelled scheduled flight) in the context of connecting transport organized by you.</p>

            <p>For certain low-cost carriers, the price of your flight has been converted from a different currency for convenience purposes to provide you an estimate of the amount of the purchase in your local currency. As a result, when you book, the
                amount charged to your credit card by the airline may be slightly different due to currency fluctuations. Your statement may also include a applicable fee from your card issuer to process the transaction plus any applicable taxes for international
                purchases.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Saltie assumes no liability for any loss or damage to baggage or personal effects, whether in transit to or from a Trip, or during a Trip.&nbsp; The airline is liable to you for the baggage you entrust to it only for the compensation contemplated
                in the international conventions and relevant statutes. &nbsp;In the event of damage, late forwarding, theft or loss of luggage, you should contact the your airline and declare the damage, absence or loss of your personal effects before
                leaving the airport, and then submit a declaration, attaching the originals of the following documents: the travel ticket, the baggage check-in slip, and the declaration.&nbsp; It is recommended that you take out an insurance policy covering
                the value of your items.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Additional and oversized baggage fees: Most airlines have their own policy regarding luggage. &nbsp;We recommend that you check with your airline ahead of time for any weight restrictions and additional charges relating to checked baggage.
                You will be responsible for paying to the airline any additional charges for checked or overweight baggage, including, but not limited to, golf bags and oversized luggage.&nbsp; If you exceed the weight limit set by your airline, and excess
                weight is permitted, you must pay a supplement directly to the airline at the airport. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in five years' imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more.&nbsp; Hazardous materials include explosives,
                compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples: Paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radio-pharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions for
                small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried on your person.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Different airlines have their own restrictions on when pregnant woman may fly on their plane, which can range from prohibiting flying anywhere from 7 to 30 days by the due date. It is your responsibility to check the restrictions of your particular
                airline. If you are denied boarding, Saltie will not be responsible for any resulting cancellation fees and charges.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinfect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have approved
                the following disinfection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not on board.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Direct flights may be &ldquo;non-stop&rdquo; or may involve one or more stop-overs (in the latter case this means the same flight by the airline, because the flight number remains the same). &nbsp;The same applies to connecting flights that
                may be subject to crew changes. &nbsp;When you reserve a scheduled or charter flight involving a stop-over in a town, and the second flight takes off from a different airport to the airport of arrival, ensure that you have sufficient time
                for reaching the second airport. &nbsp;The journey to the other airport is at your own expense. &nbsp;Saltie will not be able to reimburse you for these costs, nor will it be liable if you miss the second flight.</p>

                <li>Problems related to the issuance of e-tickets</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As of June 1st, 2008, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has imposed new rules with regard to the issuing of air travel tickets. &nbsp;As of that date, travel agencies and airlines have an obligation to only issue travel tickets
                via electronic means (i.e. electronic ticket or &ldquo;e-ticket&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Due to technical constraints to do with airline&rsquo;s restrictions in relation to certain requirements (infants under the age of 2, inter-airline agreements, groups, etc.), it may be impossible to issue an electronic ticket.&nbsp; Therefore,
                though a flight may be shown as available, it might prove impossible for us to honor your reservation.<em>&nbsp; </em>This situation, which is outside our control, will not result in liability on our part.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If we cannot issue you an e-ticket, we will contact you to propose an alternative route solution. &nbsp;This could involve a different tariff and/or additional costs for which you would be responsible. In the event of the absence of an alternative
                solution, your refusal to pay any tariff difference, or if the issuance of tickets proves impossible, we would be forced to cancel your reservation at no cost to you. We will provide you with a full refund within 30 days after determining
                that there is no alternative solution possible.</p>

                    and snorkel concessions) are operated by independent contractors. Additionally, all ship physicians, nurses, and other medical personnel are independent contractors. Saltie neither supervises nor controls the actions of these independent
                    contractors, nor makes any representation, whether express or implied, as to their suitability. You agree that Saltie assumes no responsibility, does not guarantee performance, and in no event shall be liable for any negligent or intentional

            </ol>
            <p>All cruise itineraries are subject to change due to seasonal weather conditions (and resultant variations in river and tributary water levels) affecting accessibility to locations. Thus navigation routes, times and excursions may need to be
                modified at the cruise captain&rsquo;s discretion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Saltie recommends that Travelers call cruise line or review their informative materials to find out how long before the departure passengers have to check-in. Usually it is 5 hours prior to departure. If Travelers come late to check in they
                will be denied boarding&nbsp; If Travelers book their own flights, or are in the destination days beforehand, it is their responsibility to get to the pick-up location.</p>

                or when the minimum number of participants required for providing a given activity is not reached (examples: &nbsp;group sports, children&rsquo;s clubs).&nbsp; In the early or late season some activities may not be available, some of the
                facilities (restaurant, swimming pool, etc.) may be closed, or maintenance work may be in progress. &nbsp;As a general rule, entertainment and sports activities may vary in frequency depending on how many people are staying at the time
                and on climatic conditions. &nbsp;Particularly during the high season it is possible that the number of parasols, loungers, sports equipment, etc., are insufficient for the demand. &nbsp;The opening hours of bars, restaurants, and discos,
                etc., may be irregular and dependent on the management of the establishment in question.&nbsp; Saltie cannot be liable for activities unavailable due to any of the reasons listed above.</p>
